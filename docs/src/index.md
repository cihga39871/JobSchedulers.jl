# JobSchedulers.jl

## Why JobScheduler?

We may find different tasks or programs use different CPU and memory. Some can run simultaneously, but some have to run sequentially. JobScheduler is stable, useful and powerful for task queuing and workload management, inspired by Slurm/PBS and Crontab.

## Rich Features 

- Job and task scheduler.
- Local workload manager.
- CPU, memory and run time management.
- Deferring a job until specific jobs reach specific states (dependency).
- Running a job at specific time, or a period after creating (schedule).
- Job-dependent stdout and stderr. Yes, global stdout and stderr are thread-safe with this package!
- Recurring/repetitive jobs using **Cron**-like schedule expressions.
- Automatic backup and reload.
- Minimum overhead: from creation to destory, a job only takes extra [1-2 Âµs](@ref overhead).
- Fancy progress meter in terminal.

```julia
pkg> add JobSchedulers
```

To use the package, type

```julia
using JobSchedulers
```
